# Abstract

This defines the interface for configuring hardware which communicates over UART style serial.
See built documentation at at [yaq.fyi](https://yaq.fyi/traits/uses-uart).

# Table of Contents

[TOC]

# Motivation

UART is a common subform of serial communication which writes to a serial port at a specific baud rate.
This form of serial communication is generally used for RS-232 and RS-485 style serial as well as some
forms of board level GPIO serial on certain computers.

# Proposal

## config: `serial_port` (string)

This identifies which serial port to use. On Windows this is generally something like `COM4`, on Linux it would look like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

## config: `baud_rate` (int)

The speed of UART communication. Common baud rates include 9600, 19200, and 115200.
