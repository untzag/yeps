# Abstract

This YEP defines the has-dependents trait for yaq daemons which control other yaq daemons.

# Table of Contents

[TOC]

# Motivation

Many daemons require additional hardware to be present to function: attune daemons require motors and (optionally) delays.
Delays in turn require a physical stage.
These layers of daemon access provide information to clients about relationships between hardware, including but not limited to:

- Which devices should be considered "top level" and increased in prominence to the user
- Which devices are available for operations such as tuning which require special treatment for dependent hardware
- Which devices should be accessible by nice syntax (e.g. `parent.child` notatation)

The concept for this trait is already in use in [yaqc-bluesky](https://github.com/bluesky/yaqc-bluesky/blob/master/yaqc_bluesky/_has_dependent.py).

# Specification

## Message: `get_dependent_hardware`

response: {'type': 'map', 'values': 'string'}

Returns a mapping of names to host:port strings which specify the yaq daemon of dependents.
Clients are expected to remap localhost/127.0.0.1 hosts to the host where they contact the parent daemon.
Dependents are not gauranteed to be accessible to clients which can access the parent.
As such, some parent daemons MAY provide methods to read/write attributes of dependents.

# Rejected Ideas

## Require specific config

Each daemon has unique ways of determining what the dependents are.
Some will only ever accept one hardware, some a list.
Some even have separate categories of dependent hardware that are treated differently in implementation (e.g. attune daemon opa motors vs delay stages).
Thus a consistent form for specifying dependent daemons ends up being obtuse for some daemons or under specified for others.
It is recommended that the config is well documented and accepts at least host:port strings, possibly port integers on localhost as well.
