# Motivation

Serial communication is one of the most common communication formats for hardware.
This provides a common interface for hardware which communicates in similar fashions.

# Definition

## message: `direct_serial_write`

- Parameter: message (bytes)

This provides a debugging tool to directly write bytes onto the serial bus.
This message does not return anything, and should information be returned as a result it should be logged
at an INFO level.
This method is not intended for normal use outside of debugging.
